# Jet Tagging
Analysing the Top Quark Tagging dataset, which is a famous benchmark thatâ€™s used to compare the performance of jet classification algorithms. The dataset consists of around 2 million Monte Carlo simulated events in proton-proton collisions that have been clustered into jets.

Framed as a supervised machine learning task, the goal is to train a model that can classify each jet as either a top-quark signal or quark-gluon background.
